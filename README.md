## Getting started

Prerequisites:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
- Node.js
- npm
- Gulp

The site uses a slightly modified Hugo theme by [Vicky Lai]](https://github.com/vickylai/hugo-theme-sam) called `sam` which is completely coincidental to why I chose it, honest ðŸ˜‰.

### Installation

Follow instructions in the [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) to install Hugo.

Git clone the repo into a local directory.

Install all dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Develop

### How to run

Available commands for Pug and Sass files are:

- `npm run build:pug` compiles pug files to HTML
- `npm run build:sass` compiles Sass files to compressed CSS
- `npm run autoprefixer` auto-prefixes the compiled CSS
- `npm run build` does all the above
- `npm run watch` watches Pug and Sass files for changes and automatically runs npm run build

In one terminal, watch Pug and Sass files:

```sh
npm run watch
```

In another terminal, get the local Hugo dev server running:

```sh
hugo server -D
```

The `-D` flag serves all draft blog posts.

### Images

To process jpeg and png images, place the images in `src/images/pending` and run `gulp`.

### Style Guide

This repo uses [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) formatting, where it is available for the language.

### Adding blogpost content

To add a new post:

```sh
hugo new posts/new-blog-post.md
```

Navigate to the newly created file `content/posts/new-blog-post.md` and update the front matter:

```md
---
title: "Blogpost Title"
date: "2017-01-01T10:15:16.408Z"
showDate: true
draft: false
tags: ["programming", "python"]
---
```

Add images to `src/images/pending` folder and then run `gulp`.

Link to the image like this in the markdown file: `![image text](/images/image.jpeg)`

Code blocks are added like this:

```
{{< highlight python >}}
def func():
    pass
{{< /highlight >}}
```

### Develop troubleshooting

## Release

### Build

To build a production version locally, run:

```sh
hugo
```

### Deploy

The site is hosted on Netlify. Netlify deploy config is in the `netlify.toml` file.

A push triggers a build on Netlify. If on a branch, it builds and deploys a preview.

 A push to the master branch will trigger a new deploy to `production`.

 This is why all development should take place on a feature branch, and only when ready, merge to master.

Refer to the [Netlify docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/) for more info.
