      <p>
        I live in London with my family, and I'm a Full-Stack Engineer at{' '}
        <a href="https://www.bighealth.com/">Big Health</a>. I work across
        front-end and back-end technologies but my passion is front-end, and I
        currently work and play around with React and React Native.
      </p>
      <p>
        My background is in supply chain and project management, and I worked
        for over nine years in Big Four management consulting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, Iâ€™m a family man and I like cycling, mountain biking,
        football and rugby.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is my personal website, portfolio, and blog. I also list the
        technologies I use and want to learn below. Apologies for the lack of
        design on the site, this is due to time constraints but mainly because
        whilst I want to learn more about good design, I will always be a
        developer rather than a designer.
