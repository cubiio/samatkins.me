As I wrote [recently](/100daysofcode.html), after jumping between Javascript, GoLang and Python, I've decided to heed some good advice and focus on one language for awhile. And that language is Python. 

This post is about my Sublime Text 3 set-up for programming in Python. 

As an aside, this post is about getting your machine set up to manage different Python projects - [Managing Python Projects with Virtualenv](/python-project-virtualenv.html).

## Why Sublime Text?

Whilst I’m still a fan of Atom, the number one reason I switched to Sublime is speed. As a beginner, it’s a little bit harder to set-up and get to know than Atom but still completely worth it. 

The best way to get to grips with the power of Sublime text is to check out Wes Bos’ superb course on [Sublime Text](http://wesbos.com/sublime-text-book/).

So what are the must-have Python packages for Sublime? 

## Packages


Package Control - this is not Python specific but in general. It makes installing / removing packages really easy. To browse for packages go to [Package Control - the Sublime Text package manager](https://packagecontrol.io/).

[Anaconda](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Anaconda) - this is a really powerful package for linting and autocomplete, amongst many other things. It also has a Build System (Tools - Build System - Anaconda Build System) for running Python scripts within Sublime Text where appropriate.

[Terminal](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Terminal) - not just for Python but this is useful to run Python in a Terminal inside Sublime. It is also an alternative to the Anaconda Build System.

Theme and colours - an excellent way to live browse different themes and colours directly in Sublime Text is to use the [Colorsublime package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Colorsublime). Although theme and colour is of course very much a subjective and personal choice, my current favourite for coding in Python is:

* Theme: Boxy Monokai
* Colour Scheme: Flatland Monokai

And that’s it. Any tips or recommendations regarding other packages for Python? Let me know in the comments below or on [(@cubiio) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cubiio).
