I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. Over Christmas I decided to focus in Q1 2017 on completing Udacity's Full-Stack Nanodegree. As part of this, a complementary objective is I want to really get to grips with Python.

When I read about the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge I thought it was an ideal way of holding myself accountable for my Q1 objectives. It will reinforce the habit of coding every day and helping to learn Python. I also hope to get involved in and contribute to the programming community and make some friends along the way.

### tl;dr
**Q1 2017 Objectives:**

1. Complete Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree
2. Continue to learn the Python programming language
3. Complete the #100DaysOfCode challenge*
4. Contribute to the programming community
5. Build some sh*t

(*Well, 87 days actually but I can complete the challenge in April.)
