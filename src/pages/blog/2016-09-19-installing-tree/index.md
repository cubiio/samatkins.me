This is how to install Tree on OSx. It assumes Homebrew is installed. [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is a package manager for OSx.

To install run this command using Homebrew:
``brew install tree``

Now that it is installed, here's how to use it:

``tree --help``
Useful to run this to test it installed properly. It will also display the help and various commands

``tree -a``
Lists all files and directories in the present working directory (pwd)

``tree -a <directory name>``
Shows the tree of specified directory 

``tree -d``
Lists directories only in the pwd

## Thoughts
An aside, previously I never really understood the power (and thrill) of using the command line. It's relatively simple to install and use this binary, and yet it gave me such satisfaction from discovering tree to instal/use. I think this is a sign that pursuing learning to code is the right thing for me.
