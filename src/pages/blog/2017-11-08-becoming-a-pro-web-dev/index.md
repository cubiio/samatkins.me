A few years ago I decided to transition career and become a professional web developer.  Married, with a young son, and a full time job as a management consultant (i.e. long hours and lots of travel) this was not an easy undertaking. Yet - üéâ üëç - as I write this now I have worked as a professional full stack engineer for six months.

This blogpost is the advice and tips I wish I‚Äôd had at the beginning of my learning journey, and I hope some of these prove useful to you too.

## Know your goal and be focussed on what you learn and when

I'm curious in nature and always like to play with shiny new things. Whilst this has advantages, there are clearly disadvantages such as getting distracted and not working on moving close to your actual goal. Early on when learning I would often dive off into a rabbit hole learning something which whilst perhaps useful didn't directly get me to my goal: becoming a professional web developer.

My solution was to develop a flexible framework with specific goals and objectives to reach my goal. Completing the Intro to Programming Udacity Nanodegree was an early objective. Anything that wasn't directly related to this I questioned, asking myself "what will I gain my doing this?". It stopped me on several occasions from wasting time on unnecessary diversions. Sometimes though I would allow myself to learn something which was indirectly useful. For example, I learned some Gulp which wasn't part of qualification but it taught me about web development processes and helped improve my productivity, automating some key processes.

So if you're like me, then pick what you learn and work on carefully and make sure it's moving you forwards.

## Find your learning style

Related to knowing your goal, find out how you learn best. Some examples:

I‚Äôm no good just working on learning algorithms just for the sake of learning an algorithm. I get they are important, and learning some is very important. But just trying to learn them on their own I quickly find boring. Only doing Codewars isn‚Äôt for me. I learn best my doing. Build something and work out along the way the best way to do this. Sure this means knowing your `map`from your `reduce` from your `filter` but use them whilst you're building a project.

Another one is I need community and people to turn to help guide me in the right direction. Learning to code is hard, but with the right support you can learn. I will always appreciate Free Code Camp because it helped me to discover coding but I found the self directed nature of Free Code Camp wasn't for me. Udacity on the other hand with mentor support and code reviews was a much better fit. So find what works for you and go with that.


## Build stuff

> The best way to learn to code is to code.

I don't know who this quote can be attributed to but I wholeheartedly agree with it. Once you've got some of the basics of HTML, CSS and some JavaScript, then start to build things. For me it is undoubtedly the best way to learn. I built lots of project apps, initially as part of following [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), then as part of my Udacity Nanodegree [Full Stack Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004), and then also some others independently.

As you progress, complement this with learning more about your language of choice. For example, one of my favourite parts of Wes Bos' excellent [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) course is array cardio - learning to work with array methods.


## Use abstractions to your advantage

There's an absolute ton of stuff to learn. It's impossible to learn it all. So lean on others for some of the heavy lifiting. A great example of this is I started learning React a few months ago. Using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to create a React app with no build configuration (i.e. not having to worry about WebPack) is awesome. Just run `create-react-app my-app` and then get coding in React.

In other words, be smart about what you learn. I want to learn about WebPack but for me personal there's more benefit to learning React and React Native first.

## Be professional

I had no complete idea of what it meant to be a professional web developer and six months in I'm still learning huge amounts everyday on what it is and what it means. But you can make some assumptions based on blogposts and articles and build that into your learning.

Having technical expertise and writing good code is just one part of it. Writing good documentation, using git and a service such as GitHub, working with high productivity with your editor of choice in a local environment are just some of the parts of being an engineer. This means during your own studying, you could for example:

* Write great documentation in your project READMEs
* Use git and Github (or Gitlab, Bitbucket if you prefer). If you find git on the command line intimidating, then use a GUI such as Kraken or SourceTree. Just start using git as soon as possible!
* Develop locally rather than an online service such as Codepen
* Pick an Editor/IDE e.g. Sublime, Atom, VS Code etc and configure it to your liking and master it's functionality, key bindings etc
* Use a linter e.g. flake8 for Python, ESLint for Javascript


## Market yourself
Showcase your ability, commitment and ability to learn. I have learned a lot since I started coding, and have learned even more in six months working as a web developer. My knowledge feels like a drop in ocean compared to my more experienced colleagues. But I think one of the reasons I was hired was my desire and ability to learn. Just writing this on a CV or saying this in an interview won't get you very far, you need evidence to back it up. And this is where Github (or similar comes in to play). It's a marketplace for you, your projects, your code, your documentation and your desire to learn.


## Join a community
Learning on your own can be tough. Seek out community for people also learning to code. This could be with the organisation you're learning with e.g. Free Code Camp or Udacity. Or if you're following your own path, or to complement them, definitely check out [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/) and the 100daysOfCode hashtag on Twitter organised by [@ka11away](https://twitter.com/ka11away). Both communities are superb and very supportive.


## Immerse yourself
Get familiar with terminology and what developers talk about. Podcasts are a great way of doing this. I listen to podcasts on my commute to work and it's a good way of relaxing but still learning. There's lots of great podcasts out there but some personal favourites are:

* [Syntax Podcast](https://syntax.fm/)
* [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast)
* [JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty)

Reading news, articles, blogposts and email newsletters are further good sources of information to help keep abreast of latest developments. Some recommendations include:

* [freeCodeCamp Medium publication](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/)
* [Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/)
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)

## What are you afraid of?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Best advice I&#39;ve heard and followed re my career: ‚ÄúWhat would you do if you weren&#39;t afraid?‚Äù</p>&mdash; Sam Atkins (@cubiio) <a href="https://twitter.com/cubiio/status/920764541453074434?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">18 October 2017</a></blockquote>


My motivating force was thinking "where do I want to be in 5 years time?". I was nervous about changing careers but the fear of being stuck in the same job in 5 years time was a bigger fear. I set a plan, had some contingency and fall back options and went for it.

Think what your motivating force is and use that to remind yourself of why you are doing this. I kept a log of my achievements, however minor or trivial, so in moments of despair I could look at it and remind myself of how much I had already learned, and the progress I was making to achieve my goal.

So make a plan, get learning and I look forward to welcoming you in the future as a fellow professional software engineer.
