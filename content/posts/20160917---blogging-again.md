First, some context. I have blogged before. For several years I blogged on cycling (road, mountain biking, and as a means of simply getting from A to B).

I stopped it in the end because it was very time consuming. Not just the writing but the maintenance of my self-hosted WordPress site.

I vowed when I quit, **no more blogging**.

So why start again?

## My reasons to blog

* **Learning** - to summarise this [excellent blogpost](https://emptysqua.re/blog/write-an-excellent-programming-blog/), “writing is thinking. There is no more thorough way to understand than to explain in writing.”
* **Open source** - by sharing my learning and technical knowledge to the public (sounds grand, I'm under no illusions I am likely to be the only person who will probably read this) it forces me to really learn, it may help others, and I can start the journey of becoming known in the open source community
* **Project** - building my own site (more on this in another post), I can take on a technical project and learn by doing
* **Community** - again without any illusions of grandeur, if one blogpost helps just one person then I am playing a part in the community of helping others learn to code
