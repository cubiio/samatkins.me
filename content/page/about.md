Hi, I’m Sam. I live in London with my family. I’m a Software Engineer at [Big Health](https://www.bighealth.com).

I'm self-taught and an alumnus of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). I'm happiest working on DevOps, Cloud and Back-End. I enjoy automating stuff and helping the team be more productive, shipping with resilience and speed.

## Background

I worked in supply chain and operations, first in industry for a shipping company, then a manufacturer before working as a supply chain management consultant at KPMG and EY. My work involved developing and implementing operating models, business process optimisation and working on large scale IT and Business transformation programmes as a business analyst / project manager.

In 2017 I switched career and started work as a Software Engineer at Big Health. I have worked with Python, PHP, Docker, JavaScript and mobile development using React Native. Now my focus is on developing and maintaining back-end micro-services in the Cloud. In addition, I have a growing interest in DevOps which  crosses the boundaries between my old and new career, a key reason why I am so passionate about it.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family. I speak fluent German, mid-level Polish and just started learning some Spanish. I'm a keen mountain biker and enjoy football, rugby, cycling and reading.
