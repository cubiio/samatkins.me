Hi, I’m Sam. I live in London with my family. I’m a Software Engineer at Big Health. My job is Full-Stack but my focus is Back-End and DevOps.

I mainly work with:

* Python
* Docker
* AWS

A good week at work for me involves designing / writing / maintaining a micro-service involving Python, Docker and AWS Lambda, with a bonus of automating some tasks or processes.


## Background

My background is in supply chain and logistics. I worked in industry and consulting before switching career to start working as a professional web developer in May 2017.

I have always liked to improve processes and automate stuff. After several years of basic hacking, I decided to get serious and learn to code. My motivations included a desire to be literate in a skill which is increasingly fundamental to our age and time, and also to help my son with his coding homework. I'm self-taught and an alumnus of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family. I speak fluent German, mid-level Polish and just started learning some Spanish. I'm a keen mountain biker and enjoy football, rugby, cycling and reading.
