Hi, I’m Sam. I live in London with my family, and I’m a Software Engineer at Big Health.

I work across the stack and I enjoy working with React/React Native but have recently started to focus on back-end web development. A happy day at work for me involves designing / writing / maintaining a micro-service involving Python, Docker and AWS Lambda.

## Summary of skills

| Languages  | Frameworks          | DevOps     | Databases |
-------------|---------------------|------------|-----------|
| Python     | Flask, Django       | Docker     | MySql     |
| JavaScript | React, React Native | AWS        | Postgres  |
| Node.js    | Express             | Gulp       | MongoDb   |

## Background

I worked previously in supply chain and logistics, in industry and management consulting before making the switch to working in web development.

I have always liked to improve processes and automate stuff. After several years of basic hacking, I decided to get serious and learn to code. My motivations included a desire to be literate in a skill which is increasingly fundamental to our age and time, and also to help my son with his coding homework. I'm now an alumni at Udacity alumni and have worked as a professional web developer for over 18 months.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family. I speak fluent German, mid-level Polish and just started learning some Spanish. I'm a keen mountain biker and enjoy cycling, football and rugby.
